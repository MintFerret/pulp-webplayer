# Playdate Pulp Web Player
This repo contains all of the code (that's publicly available) for the Web Player used in the [Playdate Pulp](https://playdate-wiki.com/wiki/Pulp) editor. It has been modified to remove the navbarand bitsy footer and make it easier for users to play their game's json files, since all of the game's data is within the index file. This can entirely offline without having to sign-in to the Playdate website.
